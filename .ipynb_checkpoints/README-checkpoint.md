## Getting started with Fews Grapher

To begin with, we recommend install Python 3.8.7. When that is done install `jupyter-lab`, `nltk`, `gensim`, and `pyLDAvis`:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

When `jupyter-lab` is installed run it like so:

```bash
jupyter-lab
```

This will open a browser tab. From here open up the notebook `fews-grapher.ipynb`.
